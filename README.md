Sports Graphs and Charts 
By Nate DeTorbal

This repository is a compilation of a few sports analytics graphics I have made for my internship with the BYU Athletic Department. There are examples of multiple types of graphs/charts using college football and basketball data. 

Examples of the code for the plots are found in R Markdown Files and examples of the graphs/charts are found in the images folder.
